# Improving-Deep-Neural-Networks-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Regularization-and-Optimization

[Coursera] [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?)

## About this course
* Learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications.
* Use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking.
* Implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.
* Implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
